Step 5 - Allocate a 2 dimensional array of Tnode pointers to minimize the trie into a Dawg.

Step 6 - Init the 2 dimensional array of Trie node pointers.
Completed Populating The Reduction Array.

Step 7 - Population complete.

Step 8 - Begin to tag redundant nodes as dangled - Use recursion because only direct children are considered for elimination to keep the remaining lists in tact.

 ****** HolderOfAllTnodePointers AFTER DANGLING ******



Step 10 - Dangling is complete, so replace all dangled nodes with their first mexican equivelant in the Trie to make a compressed Dawg.

 ****** Mowed TREE ******



- Mowing of the lawn is now complete, so start to assign array indices to all living nodes.
Step 12 - The use of a breadth first queue during this step ensures that lists of contiguous nodes in the array will eliminate the need for a Next pointer.

Completed Assigning Indices To Living Nodes.
Finished indexing.
NumberOfLivingNodes from after the dangling process|119271|
The numbers add up properly once again.

Step 13 - Populate the unsigned integer array with a bitwise encoding.
IndexFollower, which is the largest index assigned in the array = |119271|
NumberOfLivingNodesAfterDangling|119271|, assert that these two are equal because they must be.
The numbers add up again, excellent!

Creation of traditional Dawg is complete,

Step 14 - Store it into a 32-bit binary file for use.
Completed 32 bit traditional data binary output.
